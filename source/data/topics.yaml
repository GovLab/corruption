  short_description: >
    What are the most effective ways for getting the public to change behavior to prevent mosquito breeding and mosquito bites and get proper access to healthcare?
  focus: There are new opportunities, including innovative approaches and new communications media, to improve how governments communicate with the public so as to create greater incentives for that behavior change needed to mitigate the risk of Zika and mosquito borne illnesses. The goal of this session is to identify innovative approaches to communication that overcomes built-in inertia, preconceived beliefs and misinformation and  induces sustained behavior change.

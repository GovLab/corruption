    <p>Global and complex public health emergencies, such as Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya, threaten public health and well-being, risk disruption to global and regional trade and economic stability, and cause widespread uncertainty and concern.</p>
    <p>In response, the Governance Lab and the Inter-American Development Bank in partnership with the Governments of the <strong>City of Rio de Janeiro</strong>, <strong>Argentina</strong>, <strong>Colombia</strong> and <strong>Panama</strong>, are hosting a series of online conferences taking place August-October 2016.</p>
    <p>Instead of a handful of people meeting once at great expense in a conference room, we will use the Internet to mobilize and curate diverse and distributed expertise -- both credentialed know-how and experiential wisdom -- to identify, design and iterate upon implementable ideas that governments can use.<p>
    <p>The goal? Bring the best thinking to bear and translate good ideas into actionable proposals backed by evidence.</p>
